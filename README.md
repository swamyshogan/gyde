## 🎓 Use Cases

GYDE has been successfully applied in various protein science applications. The following case studies demonstrate the platform's capabilities:

### Structure Prediction: Protein-Protein Interaction Networks

![Interactome Dataset](docs/figures/figure3.jpg)
*Figure 3: GYDE navigation of the interactome dataset. (A) Screen shot of table and structure viewer with overlay of one AlphaFold2 prediction versus a known structure for the selected row. (B) Three GYDE plots by AlphaFold2-multimer prediction maximum confidence versus confidence standard deviation for 1381 potential protein complexes.*

GYDE was used to analyze 1381 potential protein-protein interactions from experimental proteomics data. The platform enabled rapid visualization and filtering of AlphaFold2-multimer predictions, allowing researchers to identify high-confidence interactions and prioritize targets for further experimental validation.

### Method Benchmarking: Co-folding Methods Comparison

![Runs-N-Poses Dataset](docs/figures/figure4.png)
*Figure 4: Exploring the results of the Runs_N_Poses dataset re-generated only on Boltz and Chai. (A) GYDE dataset to explore individual predictions showing superposition of predicted vs ground truth co-folding methods. (B) Prediction accuracy vs. training set similarity to validate the Runs_N_Poses results.*

GYDE facilitated the comparison of Boltz-1 and Chai-1r co-folding methods by enabling interactive exploration of prediction quality, filtering by metrics, and visual inspection of structural discrepancies through the integrated Mol* viewer.

### Antibody Engineering: Rational Design Workflows

![Antibody Design Workflow](docs/figures/figure5.png)
*Figure 5: GYDE enables antibody rational design workflows shown here mapped to the graphical interface. 1) set antibody numbering scheme. 2) choose a reference antibody for relative comparisons. 3) view a data column as a heatmap that is aligned to the residue numbers. 4) click a heatmap grid to dive deeper into sequence variabilities. 5) predict the antibody structure to review heatmap-sequence-data relationships. 6) select variants of interest to synthesize.*

GYDE streamlines antibody engineering by integrating antibody-specific annotation tools, structure prediction, heatmap visualization of variants, and picklist generation. The platform was used to analyze SARS-CoV2 antibody sequences from B-cell repertoires, identifying key residues for engineering.

### Antibody Engineering: Anti-PD-1 Design

![ProteinMPNN Design](docs/figures/figure6.png)
*Figure 6: The GYDE interface during ProteinMPNN sequence design of the anti-PD1 antibody heavy chain. The sequence viewer displays the proposed sequences from ProteinMPNN highlighting mutation occurrences. The structure viewer can be used to show the reference structure highlighting design positions or specific columnar selections. The Frequency Widget at lower left provides an interactive workbench to study mutation distributions at each site and make selections manually or based on these frequencies.*

GYDE was used to design mutants of an anti-PD-1 rabbit antibody using ProteinMPNN. The integrated workflow allowed rapid generation and selection of sequence designs, frequency analysis of mutations, and integration with experimental affinity data, resulting in a variant with improved properties.

### Protein Design: HyperTEV Engineering

![Tev Protease Design](docs/figures/figure7.jpg)
*Figure 7: GYDE implementation for a ProteinMPNN design workflow applied to engineering Tev protease. (A) Complex design space selections can be designated by sequence indices, confirmed in the structure viewer and simple dialog options control the algorithm run. (B) The design proposal output is viewed in the multiple sequence alignment including sequence logo, heat map, and sequence-associated meta data (e.g. design scores) and user data that can be used for sorting and filtering results. (C) The frequency widget allows interactive analysis and selection of key mutations and distributions.*

GYDE replicated the computational components of a published study that achieved ~20x improvement in catalytic efficiency for an engineered Tev protease. The platform's flexible design space selection, sequence logo visualization, and frequency analysis tools enabled efficient exploration of the mutational landscape.

### De Novo Design: LRRC15-binding Miniproteins

![De Novo Binder Design](docs/figures/figure8.png)
*Figure 8: GYDE enables de novo binder generation. (A) AAVs can be re-targeted to new receptors by eliminating existing glycan binding through mutagenesis and incorporating novel de novo binding motifs (in orange) into the AAV capsid protein. (B) Hotspots were manually defined on the surface of an AlphaFold model of LRRC15. (C) Experimental data can be merged into existing GYDE session using the "Merge datasets" feature which allows adding files or copy-paste table data and merging based on desired columns. (D) The resulting GYDE session with experimental data (VLP yield and mLRRC15 binding) alongside predicted structures of the binders and a table-view of all designs enable analyzing sequence-structure-function relationships.*

GYDE was used to design LRRC15-binding miniproteins for AAV capsid retargeting. The platform integrated BindCraft and RFDiffusion designs, merged experimental binding and VLP yield data, and enabled rapid analysis of sequence-structure-function relationships to identify promising candidates.
